# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm David!

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, actively seeking opportunities in full-stack development and software engineering. Through my time studying, working at my internship, and working on projects, I've become proficient in Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, and much more. Regardless of what I know now, I'm confident in my quick uptake and ability to learn new things. Moving forward, I hope to be in a position that allows me to learn from or with others as the tech space constantly evolves. 

## ðŸš§ What I'm Working On

  - A web app iteration of my [Secret Santa project](https://github.com/Dav0M/secret-santa) where I'm learning Spring and Firebase
  - Planning stages for a sports betting odds comparison tool using [odds-api](https://the-odds-api.com/)
